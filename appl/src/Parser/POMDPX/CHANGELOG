added:
    if (!(nStateFunction.checkNoMissingEntries(mymap))) {
      cerr << "ERROR in State Function " << nStateFunction.getVNameCurr() << " : there are missing transitions" << endl;
      exit(XML_INPUT_ERROR);
    }
    if (!(nFunction.checkNoMissingEntries(mymap))) {
      cerr << "ERROR in Observation Function " << nFunction.getVNameCurr() << " : there are missing transitions" << endl;
      exit(XML_INPUT_ERROR);
    }
added methods to Function.cc and Function.h
        bool checkNoMissingEntries(map<string, StateObsAct*> mymap);
